Migrated from private repository of **Engos Software** to public domain.

# 0.0.0 (October 10, 2017)
Original WebRTC library was developed in Autumn 2017, originally as the project called **kiko.live**.
It was a proof of concept of using [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) technology in day to day communication.
Because of relatively low demand for such solutions at that time, this project was frozen.
This project is the continuation of the work done in **kiko.live** by **Engos Software**.
